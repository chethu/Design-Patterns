# Design-Patterns

## What are Design Patterns 
Design patterns are reusable solutions to the problems that we encounter in the day to day programming. They are generally targeted at solving the problems of object generation and integration. In other words, Design patterns acts as templates which can be applied to the real-world programming problems.

## History and evolution of design Patterns
The four authors of the book famously know as Gang of four are the ones who brought the concepts of design patterns in their book “Elements of reusable Object-Oriented software” . 
 
Gang of Four has divided the book into two parts with first part explaining about the pros and cons of object oriented programming and the second part describes the evolution of 23 classic software design patterns.

## Types of Design Patterns
Gang of Four have categorised the design patterns in to 3 types based on different problems encountered in the real world applications. They are Creational, Structural and Behavioural.
 
1. Creational design patterns : These patterns deal with object creation and initialization. Creational pattern gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
 
 Examples of Creational design patterns category : Singleton , Factory and Abstract Factory etc.

2. Structural design patterns : This pattern deals with class and object composition. In simple words, This pattern focuses on decoupling interface, implementation of classes and its objects. 

  Examples of Structural design patterns category : Adapter,  Facade and Bridge etc.

3. Behavioural design patterns : These patterns deal with communication between Classes and objects. 

  Examples of Behavioural design patterns : Chain of Responsibility, Command and Interpreter etc.
 


## Singleton Pattern
Singleton Pattern belongs to Creational type pattern.  Gang of four have defined five design patterns 
that belongs to creational design type category. Singleton is one among them and the rest are Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder and Prototype patterns. As the name implies, creational design type deals with object creation mechanisms. Basically, to simplify this, creational pattern explain us the creation of objects in a manner suitable to a given situation. 

Singleton design pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one object of a particular class is Instantiated. That single instance created is responsible to coordinate actions across the application.
